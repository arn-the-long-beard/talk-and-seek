* Comments  

It is working on http because of the wikiJs. 

Usually I run everything on https by using http2/spdy.

You can change development.js and the page.js inside wikisj to have full https

The redux store has information about the server in case of test on local network 

There is also a promisesCollecteur to handle Async redux actions for injecting data and render ready html for SEO if we need
